# Python Automation Projects

This repository showcases a curated set of Python automation projects covering web scraping, data extraction, Excel reporting, CLI tools, and task scheduling. Each project demonstrates practical applications of Python for streamlining workflows, extracting insights, and building scalable automation pipelines.

## Project Overview

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Table Extraction** | Extract tables from websites, CSVs, and PDFs using `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `tabula-py`. |
| **Web Automation & Scraping** | Automate browser tasks with `Selenium`, navigate HTML trees, and extract data using XPath. |
| **Automate the News** | Build a news scraper with `Selenium`, export headlines to CSV, run in headless mode, and schedule with `crontab`. |
| **Excel Report Automation** | Generate pivot tables, charts, formulas, and formatted Excel reports using `openpyxl` and `pandas`. |
| **WhatsApp Automation** | Automate WhatsApp messaging workflows (details redacted for privacy). |
| **Hacker News Emailer** | Scrape Hacker News headlines and email them daily using `smtplib`. |
| **TED Talk Downloader** | Download TED videos using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, with CLI support. |
| **PDF Table Extractor** | Extract structured data from PDFs and export to CSV/Excel using `PyPDF2` and `pandas`. |
| **Bulk Resume Parser** | Parse resumes using `Spacy` and regex, extract key info, and build a one-click CLI tool. |
| **Image Type Converter** | Convert image formats and manipulate images using `Pillow`, with CLI integration. |
| **News Summarizer** | Summarize news articles using `Gensim`, schedule daily runs, and export summaries.
